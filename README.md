# Streamly

Streamly is a powerful and intuitive SaaS application designed to revolutionize asynchronous communication through screen recording, video sharing, and collaboration. Inspired by applications like Loom, Streamly enables users to easily capture their screen, webcam, or both, and instantly share videos via a link. The application consists of three core components:

1. **Website**: A user-facing platform for video management, sharing, and account handling.
2. **Electron Application**: A desktop application for screen and webcam recording.
3. **Socket.IO Express Server**: A real-time server backend enabling for video file to saved on AWS S3 and `title`, `description`, `transcription` to generated using GROQAI SDK.
